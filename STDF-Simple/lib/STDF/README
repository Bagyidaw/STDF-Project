Simple STDF parser can read and parse STDF version 4 file.
Currently not all STDF records are supported yet. I will implement them in time.
The main goal of the module is to parse records in reasonable amount of time.
So the module returns parsed records in very simple data structure. (array Reference), No objects creation, method calls overhead.
